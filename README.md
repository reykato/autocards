# autocards

my work (aidan borden, @aidan-octane) on our autocards/BrainCloud hackathon project, which you can see in the
"set generator" tab on braincloud.tech !!
i basically handled all of the AI functionality of the website, and utilized the OpenAI API in the Python backend to handle that.
then i piped it with the rest of the team into Django (+ styled it with Bootstrap. it is NOT the default bootstrap templates
i DON'T know why you would accuse me of that) and it was able to go into production on the website. it's not 100% done, i wanted more
user functionality & ease of use - for example i spent a half hour trying to figure out how to add a pop-up in case the AI is unable to generate
as many cards as the user requests - but i'm pretty proud of it. also the ai sucks because i changed a line or two of it's training and then forgot
to test it afterwards and now it has a ~50% success rate. whoops! live and learn. the whole github is spaghetti because outside factors led us to be on 
major crunch so we just had to get a working product up as fast as possible. so this repo is technically slightly outdated and not in production but on tyler's machine
we worked together to slightly modify my code to fit with his and then he pushed to staging. we were also all unfamiliar to git and mostly unfamiliar with github so 
it was very valuable learning all that stuff. idk why im wafflin here but this is my stuff :D
