BrainCloud.tech is a website that runs on a technology we named 'autocards.'
Inspired by a member of our team who swears by spaced repition memorization, BrainCloud is the foundation of an easy-to-use webapp that will serve as not only an effective 
spaced repition flashcard memorization service but an AI-powered flashcard generator, simplifying the worst part of having to memorize sets of data.

Using a combination of the Littner system, the 15-minute method, and SM-2, we developed a unique spaced repition algorithm that shows flashcards to the user in
spaced-out intervals, a scientifically proven method to most effectively memorize data in the long-term. A member of our team, Mark, loves this form of learning, 
and uses it on the daily, but feels as though any existing technology to use it is user-unfriendly, so we developed our own. 
BrainCloud is this webpage, and features:
  1. A page to create and edit a deck of cards for the user to study
  2. A page for the user to study a specific deck of cards with our developed algorithm
  3. A page for the user to utilize AI technology to auto-generate a set of cards. This is limited to 25 cards, purely because of our limited resources with the
     OpenAI API, and this website is in a demo state. However, this can be greatly expanded upon with more resources.
This is a standalone website that we intended to have significantly more features on, but as it is most of our first hackathon, that did not happen. Currently, it is (as
aforementioned) in a demo state, and cannot be easily traversed as we wish the user would be able to with redirecting between each page.
With extra time, we would be fully able to (and planned to):
  1. Sync with a user database, and have dedicated user-profiles to store flashcard sets with each user. Currently, the website is a free-for-all :P
  2. Implement a public database of cards for users to upload generated flashcard sets to, and allow users to search through to download other's sets.
  3. Save user's progress in each of their decks, so that they can revisit the cards and their spaced repition progress will save across sessions.
  4. Improve the style of the website.
